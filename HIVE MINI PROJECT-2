Objective - The assignment is meant for you to apply learnings of the module on Hive on a real-life dataset. One of the major 
objectives of this assignment is gaining familiarity with how an analysis works in Hive and how you can gain insights from large 
datasets.
 
Problem Statement - New York City is a thriving metropolis and just like most other cities of similar size, one of the biggest 
problems its residents face is parking. The classic combination of a huge number of cars and a cramped geography is the exact recipe 
that leads to a large number of parking tickets.
 
In an attempt to scientifically analyse this phenomenon, the NYC Police Department regularly collects data related to parking tickets.
This data is made available by NYC Open Data portal. We will try and perform some analysis on this data.

Download Dataset - https://data.cityofnewyork.us/browse?q=parking+tickets

Note: Consider only the year 2017 for analysis and not the Fiscal year.

The analysis can be divided into two parts:
 
Part-I: Examine the data

Q-1-Find the total number of tickets for the year.

Q-2-Find out how many unique states the cars which got parking tickets came from.
A-2-select count(distinct Registration_State) as No_of_States from park_viol_part_buck;


Q-3-Some parking tickets don’t have addresses on them, which is cause for concern. Find out how many such tickets there are(i.e. 
tickets where either "Street Code 1" or "Street Code 2" or "Street Code 3" is empty )
A-3-select count(distinct summons_number) as No_Tickets_without_address from violations_parking where Street_code1 = 0 or 
Street_code2 = 0 or Street_code3 = 0;


Part-II: Aggregation tasks

Q-1-How often does each violation code occur? (frequency of violation codes - find the top 5).
A-1- select count(Violation_Code) as frequency_of_violation,Violation_Code from park_viol_part_buck group by Violation_Code order by
frequency_of_violation desc limit 5;

Q-2-How often does each vehicle body type get a parking ticket? How about the vehicle make? (find the top 5 for both)
A-2-select Vehicle_Body_Type,count(summons_number) as frequency_of_getting_parking_ticket from park_viol_part_buck group by 
Vehicle_Body_Type order by frequency_of_getting_parking_ticket desc limit 5;

Q-3-A precinct is a police station that has a certain zone of the city under its command. Find the (5 highest) frequencies of:
      a.) Violating Precincts (this is the precinct of the zone where the violation occurred)
      Ans-select Violation_Precinct,count(*) as IssuedTicket from violations_parking group by Violation_Precinct order by IssuedTicket
      desc limit 5;
      b.) Issuer Precincts (this is the precinct that issued the ticket)
      Ans-select Issuer_Precinct,count(*) as IssuedTicket from violations_parking group by Issuer_Precinct order by IssuedTicket 
      desc limit 5;
      

Q-4-Find the violation code frequency across 3 precincts which have issued the most number of tickets - do these precinct zones have 
an exceptionally high frequency of certain violation codes?
A-4-select Issuer_Precinct,Violation_Code, count(*) as TicketsIssued from park_viol_part_buck group by Issuer_Precinct, Violation_Code
order by TicketsIssued desc limit 7;
select Violation_Code, count(*) as TicketsIssued from park_viol_part_buck where Issuer_Precinct=18 group by Violation_Code order by 
TicketsIssued desc limit 7;
select Violation_Code, count(*) as TicketsIssued from park_viol_part_buck where Issuer_Precinct=19 group by Violation_Code order by
TicketsIssued desc limit 7;
select Violation_Code, count(*) as TicketsIssued from park_viol_part_buck where Issuer_Precinct=14 group by Violation_Code order by
TicketsIssued desc limit 7;

Q-5-Find out the properties of parking violations across different times of the day: The Violation Time field is specified in a 
strange format. Find a way to make this into a time attribute that you can use to divide into groups.
A-5-select from_unixtime(unix_timestamp(regexp_extract(violation_time,'(.*)[AZ]',1),'HHmm'),"HH:mm") as data from violations_parking
limit 7;
select from_unixtime(unix_timestamp(concat(violation_time,'M'),'HHmmaaa'),"HH:mmaaa") as data from violations_parking limit 7;


Q-6-Divide 24 hours into 6 equal discrete bins of time. The intervals you choose are at your discretion. For each of these groups, 
find the 3 most commonly occurring violations
A-6-create view park_viol_part_view partitioned on (Violation_Code) as
select Summons_Number, Violation_Time, Issuer_Precinct,
case
when substring(Violation_Time,1,2) in ('00','01','02','03','12') and
upper(substring(Violation_Time,-1))='A' then 1
when substring(Violation_Time,1,2) in ('04','05','06','07') and
upper(substring(Violation_Time,-1))='A' then 2
when substring(Violation_Time,1,2) in ('08','09','10','11') and
upper(substring(Violation_Time,-1))='A' then 3
when substring(Violation_Time,1,2) in ('12','00','01','02','03') and
upper(substring(Violation_Time,-1))='P' then 4
when substring(Violation_Time,1,2) in ('04','05','06','07') and
upper(substring(Violation_Time,-1))='P' then 5
when substring(Violation_Time,1,2) in ('08','09','10','11') and
upper(substring(Violation_Time,-1))='P'then 6
else null end as Violation_Time_bin,Violation_Code
from park_viol_part_buck
where Violation_Time is not null or (length(Violation_Time)=5 and
upper(substring(Violation_Time,-1))in ('A','P')
and substring(Violation_Time,1,2) in ('00','01','02','03','04','05','06','07',
'08','09','10','11','12'));

BIN=1
select Violation_Code,count(*) TicketsIssued from park_viol_part_view where
Violation_Time_bin == 1 group by Violation_Code order by TicketsIssued desc
limit 2;
BIN2
select Violation_Code,count(*) TicketsIssued from park_viol_part_view where
Violation_Time_bin == 2 group by Violation_Code order by TicketsIssued desc
limit 2;
BIN3
select Violation_Code,count(*) TicketsIssued from park_viol_part_view where
Violation_Time_bin == 3 group by Violation_Code order by TicketsIssued desc

BIN6

Violation_Time_bin == 6 group by Violation_Code order by TicketsIssued desc
limit 3;




Q-7-Now, try another direction. For the 3 most commonly occurring violation codes, find the most common times of day (in terms of the
bins from the previous part)
A-7-select Violation_Time_bin, count(*) TicketsIssued from park_viol_part_view where Violation_Code in (21,36,37,38) group by
Violation_Time_bin order by TicketsIssued desc limit 3;


8.) Let’s try and find some seasonality in this data
a.) First, divide the year into some number of seasons, and find frequencies of tickets for each season. (Hint: A quick Google
      search reveals the following seasons in NYC: Spring(March, April, March); Summer(June, July, August); Fall(September, October,
      November); Winter(December, January, February))
Ans-create view tickets_issued_view_part partitioned on (Violation_Code) as 
select Issuer_Precinct,
case
when MONTH(Issue_Date) between 03 and 05 then 'spring'
when MONTH(Issue_Date) between 06 and 08 then 'summer'
when MONTH(Issue_Date) between 09 and 11 then 'autumn'
when MONTH(Issue_Date) in (1,2,12) then 'winter'
else 'unknown' end as season,Violation_Code from
violations_parking;
select season, count(*) as TicketsIssued from tickets_issued_view_part group by
season order by TicketsIssued desc;


b.)Then, find the 3 most common violations for each of these seasons.
Ans-
select Violation_Code, count(*) as TicketsIssued from tickets_issued_view_part
where season = 'spring' group by Violation_Code order by TicketsIssued desc
limit 3;
select Violation_Code, count(*) as TicketsIssued from tickets_issued_view_part
where season = 'spring' group by Violation_Code order by TicketsIssued desc limit 3;
select Violation_Code, count(*) as TicketsIssued from tickets_issued_view_part
where season = 'autumn' group by Violation_Code order by TicketsIssued desc limit 3;
select Violation_Code, count(*) as TicketsIssued from tickets_issued_view_part
where season = 'winter' group by Violation_Code order by TicketsIssued desc limit 3;

Note: Please ensure you make necessary optimizations to your queries like selecting the appropriate table format, using partitioned/
bucketed tables. Marks will be awarded for keeping the performance also in mind.
